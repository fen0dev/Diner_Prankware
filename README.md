# Diner_Prankware
# Faky_Booky.py

I'm not even sure prankware is a word, LOL! Anyhoo, this project was made for fun and pure fun only. It was coded in Python as you can see :)

The purpose of this project is: none, boredom. I had a friend oncee who said: "If you want to know what fear is: give a laptop to a bored hacker!" :)))))

That being said, despite being a useful tool for, in this very instance, booking a table for you and your friends at your favourite restaurant (the example is my favourite restaurant). The software can actually harm the targeted place since it's a "Faky_booky" software which inputs fake names, emails, and phone numbers. 
It uses the powerful selenium web-scraping automation module, therefore, if you misuse it and start fooling around by making fake bookings, it might result in financial loss from the organization, booking servers mismanagement and whatnot and they could even come after you! 
Use it then properly, do not misuse it! It could get you in, somehwat, big troubles :)

# GENERATE.PY

The fake credentials are generated by this script which you can find in the respository. The script is very easy and intuitive. You can figure the code out by yourself :)

# Scrapeproxies.py

That's pretty mmuch self-explanatory. You will be scraping proxies andd try to be less visible :)



Have fun coding!
