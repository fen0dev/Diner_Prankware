# Faky_Booky.py - UPDATE v1.1.0

I'm not even sure prankware is a word, LOL! This project was made for fun and pure fun only.
It was coded entirely in Python as you can see :)

Anyhoo, I have indeed updated my own code! There have been major bug fixes over generating new contacts and integrating them into the main script. I have also removed the "generate.py" file since it had the same functionality of generating new names, emails, phone numbers and whatnot. Now, you have everythong in one! :)
One of the functions will also save the fresh new generated contacts into a ".txt" file and it's gonna repeat the booking for 5 times (Why 5? Because I set it up this way, you can of course change it).

The purpose of this project is: none, boredom. I had a friend once who said: "If you want to know what fear is: give a laptop to a bored hacker!" xD

That being said, despite being a useful tool for, in this very instance, booking a table for you and your friends at your favourite restaurant (the example is my favourite restaurant). The software can actually harm the targeted place since it's a "Faky_booky" software which inputs fake names, emails, and phone numbers. 
It uses the powerful selenium web-scraping automation module, therefore, if you misuse it and start fooling around by making fake bookings, it might result in misuse and financial loss from the organization's side, server mismanagement and someone could even possibly come after and sue you for this!

It is strongly suggested to take the script as example for growth and skillset imporvement!


Have fun coding! :)
