# Faky_Booky.py - UPDATE v1.1.0

I'm not even sure prankware is a word, LOL! This project was made for fun and pure fun only. It is coded entirely in Python as you can see :)

Anyhoo, I have indeed updated my own code! There have been major bug fixes over generating new contacts and integrating them into the main script. I have also removed the "generate.py" file since I have implemented it in one code. Now, you have everything in one! :)
One of the functions will also save the fresh new generated contacts into a ".txt" file and it's gonna repeat the booking for 5 times (Why 5? Because I set it up this way, you can of course change it).

That being said, despite being a useful tool for, in this very instance, booking a table for you and your friends at your favourite restaurant (the example is my favourite restaurant), the software can actually harm the targeted place since it's a fake booking software which inputs fake names, emails, and phone numbers. 
It uses the powerful selenium web-scraping automation module, therefore, if you misuse it and start fooling around by making fake bookings, it might result in misuse and financial loss from the organization's side, server mismanagement and someone could even possibly come after and sue you for this!

It is strongly suggested to take the script as example for growth and skillset imporvement such as: if you are to develop a website that has to do with 3rd party servers handling some stuff for you (or anything within the semantic field). I do recommend, then, that you make sure that the selenium (aka selenium base) module(s) gets detected otherwise maleficent things may happen to your website!

If you appreciate my work, I do not need anything, I'm just happy to contribute :D

Have fun coding, stay safe!
